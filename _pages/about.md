I am now a second-year doctoral student in the <a href='http://ir.hit.edu.cn/'>Social Computing and Information Retrieval (HIT-SCIR)</a> at Harbin Institute of Technology, supervised by Prof. Ming Liu.
Previously, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2022. 

My research interests lie in natural language reasoning, including question answering, natural langauge reasoning, chain-of-thought reasoning, LLM-based agents and multimodal reasoning.
Besides, I am also interested in how LLMs acquire reasoning ability.
